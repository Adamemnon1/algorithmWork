# algorithmWork

This repository has my work on the Divide and Conquer use for Recursion. 
These files were made to take in a file of (x, y) points, parse it, then use the 
ClosestPair algorithms to find the pair of points that are the closest to each other
in distance. The code was written with time efficiency in mind. 
This code was written in Java in Eclipse.

ClosestPair.java - the file with the actual Divide and Conquer algorithm. This file has most of my work.

Comparator.java - a useful interface for comparing two (x, y) points.

CopyOfRange. java - code used for dividing the given (x, y) points into smaller pieces that can 
  more quickly be calculated over. This file has most of my work.

PointReader.java - utility obect to read in the file of points and place them into arrays.

This repository consists of large sections of code provided to me, and then I wrote the code that implements the actual algorithm.
